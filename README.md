Repository for Festkommitt√©n FestUs webpage festu.se

## Description
This repository contains the different parts of the new website for FestU. 

### Frontend
The frontend is written using Angular for logic and Bootstrap for CSS. Browse the different folders in static/public/ in order to get some feel for it.

### Backend
Node backend. Throw files and data on everyone!

## Getting-started
This is a simple guide describing how to get started.

### Running for the first time
If you are running for the first time you have to install the dependencies from npm:

`npm install`

### Development.
We use Webpack DevServer during development. The dev server runs on port 8080 and expects a backend
proxy on port 5000. Run nodemon and webpack dev server simultaneously with:

`npm run dev`
